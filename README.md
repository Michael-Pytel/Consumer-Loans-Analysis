# Consumer-Loans-Analysis

This project explores and analyzes the Consumer Loans dataset from Kaggle.

**Data Source:** [Consumer loans dataset | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zafish/consumer-loans)

**Data Description**

The dataset contains information about loan applicants, including their income , marital status, education, and loan outcomes (if the loan was finalized), etc...

**Project Goals**

* Understand consumer loan characteristics and trends.
* Identify factors influencing loan finalization.
* Develop models to predict loan risk (probability of default).

**Data Analysis and Exploration**

* Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions of loan amounts and borrower characteristics.
* Visualizing the data using histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and correlation plots.
* Performing data cleaning and pre-processing (handling missing values, outliers, etc.).
  
**Feature Engineering** 
* Creating new features

**Model Development** (still in progress)
